# Smart Home IoT System – System Design Case Study

## Problem Statement
Design a scalable and secure smart home system using ESP32 devices that allows users to remotely control appliances and monitor device states in real time.

## Objectives
- Enable remote device control
- Ensure reliable device communication
- Handle device failures gracefully
- Design for scalability and security

## Scope
This project focuses on system architecture and design. Device behavior is validated using virtual ESP32 simulation.

## System Architecture

The smart home system is designed using a layered architecture to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance.

### Device Layer
ESP32 devices are responsible for controlling appliances and reporting their current state. Devices connect to the network over Wi-Fi and communicate with the backend using lightweight protocols.

### Communication Layer
This layer handles data exchange between devices and the backend. Protocols such as HTTP or MQTT are used to ensure reliable and low-latency communication.

### Backend Layer
The backend acts as the central controller of the system. It manages device registration, routes control commands, maintains device states, and logs all activities.

### Database Layer
The database stores device metadata, current status, activity logs, and user information. A NoSQL database is preferred for flexible schema design and scalability.

### Dashboard Layer
The web dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to monitor device states, control appliances, and view historical activity logs in real time.
